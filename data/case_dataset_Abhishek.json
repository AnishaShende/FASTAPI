    "Case No.": "C.S.No.1012 of 2007",
    "Case Name": "Smt.G.Veda vs Mrs.M.Manoranjitham",
    "Date": "28-November-2016",
    "Court": "Madras High Court",
    "Case Status": "Judgement",
    "Judges Involved": "M. Sundar",
    "Sections and Clauses": "Order IV Rule 1, Order VII Rule 1 of O.S.Rules r/w. C.P.C.",
    "Facts": "The plaintiff, Smt.G.Veda, claims ownership of the suit property (Plot No. 31) based on a sale deed dated 03.08.1989.\r\nThe defendant, Mrs.M.Manoranjitham, claims ownership based on a sale deed obtained through a decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986. This decree was passed against C.V.Arangesa Mudaliar, who held a Power of Attorney for the property.\r\nThe defendant was aware of the plaintiff's possession and ownership claim but did not include her in the suit leading to the decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986.",
    "Petition Filed": "The plaintiff filed a suit for a declaration of ownership of the suit property and a declaration that the judgement and decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 is not binding on her. She also sought an injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with her possession.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the plaintiff is the absolute owner of the suit property.\r\nWhether the judgment and decree dated 01.09.2004 in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 is valid and binding on the plaintiff.\r\nWhether the plaintiff is entitled to a permanent injunction against the defendant.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 is valid, given the defendant's knowledge of the plaintiff's possession and ownership claim, and her failure to include her in the suit.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The defendant's decree is not valid because she knew about the plaintiff's possession and ownership claim but deliberately chose not to include her in the suit.\r\nThe defendant's claim to ownership is based on a sale agreement with C.V.Arangesa Mudaliar, who was not a legitimate power of attorney holder and whose signature on the sale agreement is questionable.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The plaintiff's vendor violated the conditions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act, rendering her sale deed invalid.\r\nThe plaintiff should have appealed the decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 instead of filing a separate suit.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the defendant was aware of the plaintiff's possession and ownership claim.\r\nThe court considered the fact that the defendant's claim relies on a transaction with C.V.Arangesa Mudaliar, who was disowned by the original owners and whose signature is questionable.\r\nThe court held that the defendant's failure to include the plaintiff in the previous suit, despite knowing about her ownership claim, is a fatal flaw and renders the decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 invalid.",
    "Decision": "The court held that the decree in O.S.No.7228 of 1986 is not valid and not binding on the plaintiff.\r\nThe court declared the plaintiff to be the absolute owner of the suit property.\r\nThe court granted a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff's possession and enjoyment of the property.",
    "Conclusion": "The court found that the defendant's claim to ownership was based on a decree obtained through deception and without proper legal procedures. This led to the court finding in favor of the plaintiff, recognizing her as the rightful owner of the property and protecting her right to peaceful possession.",
    "Case Summary": "This case revolved around a property dispute between Smt.G.Veda and Mrs.M.Manoranjitham. Both claimed ownership of the property. Veda's claim was based on a valid sale deed, while Manoranjitham claimed ownership through a decree obtained in an earlier suit. The court found that Manoranjitham knew about Veda's possession and ownership claim but deliberately excluded her from the previous suit, rendering the decree invalid. Therefore, the court declared Veda the rightful owner of the property and protected her possession by issuing an injunction against Manoranjitham."

    "Sections and Clauses": "Sections 498(A), 406, 420, 323 r/w 34 IPC, Section 188 Cr.P.C.",
    "Facts": "The second respondent (defacto complainant) and the first petitioner were married in 2003.\r\nAfter marriage, they moved to UK where the first petitioner allegedly subjected the second respondent to physical, mental, and economic abuse, demanding dowry and misappropriating her earnings.\r\nThe second respondent filed a complaint in India in 2011 alleging dowry harassment, criminal breach of trust, and misappropriation of her money.\r\nThe first petitioner obtained a divorce in the UK in 2010, which the second respondent did not contest.\r\nThe first petitioner became a UK citizen in 2011.\r\nThe trial court took cognizance of the case based on the complaint filed by the second respondent.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioners filed a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the proceedings in the trial court.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the trial court could take cognizance of the case without obtaining sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C. for offences committed outside India?\r\nWhether the allegations against the petitioners were merely based on a false complaint intended to harass them?\r\nWhether the divorce decree obtained in the UK could be considered in the present case?",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the petitioners could be prosecuted in India for offences committed partly in India and partly in UK, without sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C.?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The allegations against the petitioners were false and unsupported by any evidence.\r\nThe offences were committed mainly in UK, and the trial court should have obtained sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C. before taking cognizance.\r\nThe divorce decree obtained in UK was binding on the second respondent under Indian law.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The offences against the second respondent were committed both in India and UK, including acts of dowry harassment, misappropriation, and breach of trust.\r\nThe first petitioner had admitted receiving money from the second respondent, which he allegedly misappropriated.\r\nThe divorce decree obtained in UK did not have a bearing on the criminal charges against the petitioners.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The Court acknowledged that the first petitioner became a UK citizen in 2011 but noted that the offences alleged against him occurred prior to this.\r\nThe Court held that the allegations of dowry harassment, misappropriation, and breach of trust had elements taking place both in India and UK, making Section 188 Cr.P.C. inapplicable.\r\nThe Court also emphasized that the divorce decree obtained in the UK was not a factor in determining the criminal charges against the petitioners.",
    "Decision": "The Court dismissed the petition, finding that there was sufficient prima facie evidence to proceed with the trial against the petitioners.",
    "Conclusion": "The Court concluded that the petitioners could be prosecuted in India for offences committed partly in India and partly in UK, despite not obtaining sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C. The Court also held that the divorce decree obtained in the UK was not relevant to the criminal charges against the petitioners.",
    "Case Summary": "The petitioners challenged the trial court's cognizance of the case, claiming that the offences were mainly committed in UK and that sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C. was required. The Court dismissed the petition, finding that the allegations involved actions in both India and UK and that the divorce decree obtained in the UK did not affect the criminal proceedings. The Court allowed the trial to proceed, concluding that sufficient evidence existed to support the charges against the petitioners."

    "Key Legal Questions": "Did the prosecution establish the appellants' guilt for the charges of conspiracy, forgery, and corruption?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "There was no direct evidence of conspiracy.\r\nThe prosecution failed to establish the connection between A.1 and A.2.\r\nThe loan amounts were covered by insurance, indicating the loans were not fraudulent.\r\nThe FIR did not mention the names of the specific loanees mentioned in the final report.\r\nThe prosecution should have examined the actual loanees, not individuals from nearby villages.\r\nThe specimen signatures of A.2 were not obtained following the Identification of Prisoners Act.\r\nThe prosecution failed to prove A.3's mens rea (criminal intent) for issuing false land certificates.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "Circumstantial evidence proved the conspiracy between the appellants.\r\nThe conduct of A.2 supported the prosecution's case.\r\nThe evidence of the fake land records, handwriting expert, and postal delivery agent corroborated the charges.\r\nThe absence of specific names in the FIR did not vitiate the prosecution.\r\nThe prosecution presented both positive and negative evidence to prove the charges.\r\nThe sanction granted under Section 19 of the PC Act was valid.\r\nThe appellants failed to present any genuine loanees to refute the prosecution's case.",

    "Facts": "The claimants (A.Savariammal, her children, and mother) filed a Motor Accident Claims Petition (M.C.O.P.) for the death of Aurlanandhu.\r\nThe accident involved a Mahindra Van, bearing Registration No. TN-45-C-4500, insured by the National Insurance Company Limited.\r\nThe Tribunal awarded Rs. 3,17,000/- to the claimants, finding that the insurance company admitted coverage.\r\nAfter four years, the insurance company sought to recall the award, alleging fraud by the claimants regarding the insurance policy.\r\nThe insurance company claimed they initially believed the policy due to a software error and only discovered the alleged fraud later.",
    "Petition Filed": "no Petition Filed",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to recall the award under Section 151 C.P.C. based on the insurance company's claim of fraud.\r\nWhether the claimants actually committed fraud, considering the insurance company's admission of coverage.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Can an award be recalled based on alleged fraud when the insurer initially admitted coverage and then later claimed a software error led to a belated discovery of fraud?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The claimants committed fraud by misrepresenting the insurance policy details.\r\nThe Tribunal has inherent power under Section 151 C.P.C. to recall awards obtained through fraud.\r\nThe software error prevented them from detecting the fraud earlier.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "No fraud was committed, and the insurance company admitted coverage in their counter statement.\r\nThe insurance company's claim of software error and belated discovery of fraud is a flimsy excuse.\r\nThe insurance company should have verified the policy details before filing their counter statement.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court analyzed the evidence presented, including the claimants' documents, witnesses, and the insurance company's affidavit.\r\nThe court found no evidence of fraud committed by the claimants.\r\nThe insurance company's claim of software error was not credible, as there were established procedures for verifying insurance coverage.\r\nThe court relied on previous judgments emphasizing the responsibility of insurance companies to verify policy details and avoid \"deny everything and await the award syndrome.\"\r\nThe court recognized the hardship faced by claimants who have to wait for compensation while insurers delay proceedings.",

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The accident was caused by composite negligence of both the lorry and bus drivers.\r\nThe lorry was insured by Respondent No. 1, and the insurance company should be held liable.\r\nThe compensation awarded by the Tribunal was inadequate.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "Respondent No. 1: The accident was caused solely by the negligence of the lorry driver. The lorry was not insured on the date of the accident because the premium was not paid until after the accident. The cover note was issued before the accident, but it was not binding because the premium was not paid.\r\nRespondent No. 2: The accident was caused by the negligence of the bus driver. The lorry was insured by Respondent No. 1, and the insurance company should be held liable.\r\nRespondent No. 3: The accident was caused by the negligence of the lorry driver.

    "Court's Reasoning": "Composite negligence: The court found no evidence of composite negligence.

The court also held that the insurance company (Respondent No. 1) was not liable because the lorry was not insured on the date of the accident.",
    "Case Summary": "The case involved a fatal accident involving a bus and a lorry. The claimants, the deceased's wife and daughter, sought compensation from the lorry owner, the bus owner, and the insurance company. The court found that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the lorry driver, and that the lorry was not insured on the date of the accident because the premium was not paid. Therefore, the court held that the insurance company was not liable and awarded the compensation amount to the claimants directly from the lorry owner.

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The claimants argued that the 1st respondent vehicle was involved in the accident, as the police investigation implicated it.\r\nThe claimants claimed that the evidence provided by the insurance company was not sufficient to absolve them of responsibility.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The insurance company argued that the vehicle was not involved in the accident and the police mistakenly identified it due to its color similarity to the offending vehicle.\r\nThey presented evidence that the vehicle was not damaged in a way that would be consistent with the alleged accident.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court considered the conflicting evidence presented by both parties.\r\nThe court noted that the police investigation was initially lethargic but took momentum after the victim's father brought it to the attention of higher officials.\r\nThe court found that the owner of the vehicle and her husband conveniently forgot the name of the driver at the time of the accident.\r\nWhile acknowledging the conflicting evidence, the court found that the preponderance of probability supported the conclusion that the Maruti Suzuki Ritz car was involved in the accident.",

    "Facts": "Two separate but similar cases involving the petitioner, B. Safeer Babu, and two different de-facto complainants, Prasant Kumar Sahoo and Arun Paul. The de-facto complainants purchased cashew nuts from the petitioner, who was acting as a middleman for a third party seller in Africa. Upon arrival in India, the containers were found to have a shortage of cashew nuts. The petitioner subsequently agreed to make good the loss by supplying additional quantities of cashew nuts. The de-facto complainants alleged that the petitioner failed to keep his promise, and filed criminal complaints against him.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioner sought to quash the First Information Reports (FIRs) filed against him, arguing that the case involved a civil dispute arising from a breach of contract and that the de-facto complainants were attempting to give a criminal colour to a commercial transaction.",

    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether a civil dispute arising from a breach of contract can also involve criminal liability?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioner argued that the case involved a breach of contract and not criminal activity. He also argued that the offences occurred outside India, requiring prior sanction under Section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He further argued that the dispute should be settled through arbitration, as per the agreement.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The de-facto complainants argued that the petitioner's conduct constituted criminal activity, specifically cheating under Section 420 IPC. They argued that the petitioner's actions involved a dishonest intent to deceive and that the availability of a civil remedy did not preclude criminal proceedings. They also argued that the petitioner's failure to provide a VGM certificate, which would show the actual tonnage of the cashew nuts at the time of loading, evidenced a guilty mind.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The Court held that the petitioner's arguments regarding Section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not valid, as the consequence of the alleged offenses occurred in India. The Court also held that a civil dispute can involve criminal liability if there is evidence of dishonest intent and cheating. The Court stated that the petitioner's failure to fulfill his undertaking to supply additional cashew nuts and his refusal to provide the VGM certificate suggested a potential criminal intent.",
    "Decision": "The Court dismissed both petitions, concluding that the investigation should be allowed to proceed to its logical conclusion.",
    "Conclusion": "The Court ruled that the petitioner's attempt to quash the FIRs was unsuccessful. The Court found that the allegations against the petitioner, if proven, could constitute criminal activity under Section 420 IPC.",
    "Case Summary": "The petitioner attempted to quash the FIRs filed against him, claiming that the case involved a civil dispute arising from a breach of contract.

The respondent countered that it was a sick company under SICA and that the matter was pending before BIFR.

    "Facts": "Gayatri Balasamy, the appellant, was employed by ISG Novasoft Technologies Limited, the first respondent, as Vice President. She alleged sexual harassment and filed a claim petition seeking compensation under 12 heads. The Arbitrator awarded Rs. 2 crore, but the appellant challenged the award regarding the rejection of claims under certain heads. The first respondent appealed against the enhancement of compensation under one of the claims.",
    "Petition Filed": "The appellant filed an Original Petition under Section 34 of The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging the award passed by the Arbitrator regarding the rejection of her claims. The first respondent appealed against the enhancement of compensation granted by the single judge under claim No. 12.",
    "Legal Issues": "The legal issues revolved around whether the court could modify the Arbitrator's award under Section 34 of the Act, the validity of the appellant's various claims, and whether the first respondent's failure to constitute a Vishaka committee for sexual harassment complaints was a breach of contract and warranted compensation.",

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The appellant argued that the arbitrator erred in rejecting her claims and that she was entitled to exemplary damages for the first respondent's breaches of the employment agreement, including non-revision of salary, non-relocation to the US, and failure to provide stock options. The appellant argued that the first respondent's failure to constitute a Vishaka committee for sexual harassment complaints was a breach of public policy and warranted compensation.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The first respondent argued that the court lacked the power to modify the arbitrator's award and that the single judge erred in awarding additional compensation under claim No. 12 for non-constitution of the Vishaka committee. The first respondent contended that the appellant's claims were not valid and that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism in place.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court concluded that it was within its power to modify the arbitrator's award under Section 34 of the Act, especially if the award was found to be in conflict with public policy. The court found that the first respondent's failure to constitute a Vishaka committee as directed by the Supreme Court constituted a breach of public policy and warranted compensation. However, the court found the single judge's awarded compensation excessive and modified it.",
    "Decision": "The court confirmed the judgment and decree passed by the single judge, but modified the compensation awarded under claim No. 12 to Rs. 50,000. The appeal filed by the first respondent was partly allowed, while the appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed.",

The court also found that the first respondent's failure to constitute a Vishaka committee was a breach of public policy and warranted compensation, but modified the compensation amount.",
    "Case Summary": "The appellant claimed compensation for various breaches of the employment agreement and argued that the first respondent's failure to constitute a Vishaka committee for sexual harassment complaints was a breach of public policy.

    "Facts": "Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited (NLC) issued tender enquiries for supply of materials and Phoenix Yule Ltd (Phoenix) was awarded the contract. There was a delay in supply and liquidated damages were deducted from Phoenix's bills. Phoenix demanded a refund of the liquidated damages and the matter was referred to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the liquidated damages were justified but reduced them to 50%. NLC challenged the award, and the lower court set aside the award, upholding the full amount of liquidated damages. Phoenix appealed the lower court's decision.",
    "Petition Filed": "Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited (NLC) filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to set aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the court was correct in setting aside the award on the grounds that it was against public policy and that the Arbitral Tribunal erred in modifying the liquidated damages clause.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Can an Arbitral Tribunal modify a liquidated damages clause in a contract, even if it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "Phoenix argued that the lower court exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act and that the award was not against public policy. They maintained that the Arbitral Tribunal was justified in modifying the liquidated damages based on principles of equity and reasonableness.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "NLC argued that the lower court correctly set aside the award as it violated the terms of the contract, which clearly defined the liquidated damages clause. They asserted that the Arbitral Tribunal had no authority to modify the terms of the contract.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court reviewed the relevant legal precedent, particularly the ONGC case, which established that the phrase \"public policy of India\" in Section 34 of the Act has a broader meaning, encompassing situations where an award is patently illegal. The court determined that the Arbitral Tribunal's modification of the liquidated damages clause without valid justification was patently illegal and therefore contrary to public policy.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court's decision to set aside the Arbitral Tribunal's award.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the Arbitral Tribunal had exceeded its authority by modifying the liquidated damages clause without a valid legal basis. This modification was deemed to be patently illegal and therefore contrary to public policy.",
    "Case Summary": "Phoenix Yule Ltd argued that the lower court had overstepped its authority in setting aside the arbitral award, which they believed was justified under principles of fairness and equity. Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited (NLC) argued that the lower court was correct in setting aside the award, as it violated the explicit terms of the contract regarding liquidated damages. The court, citing the ONGC case, concluded that an award can be set aside if it is patently illegal, and the arbitral tribunal's modification of the liquidated damages without sufficient justification was deemed to be such an illegality. The court ultimately upheld the lower court's decision to set aside the award."

    "Facts": "The case involved a dispute arising from a Master Services Agreement (MSA) between the Government of Tamil Nadu, the Petitioner (M/s. 3i Infotech Limited), and the first Respondent (Tamil Nadu e-Government Agency). The MSA required the Petitioner to set up 4395 Common Service Centres (CSCs) in Tamil Nadu. The Petitioner set up a limited number of CSCs, resulting in a termination notice from the first Respondent. The Petitioner initiated arbitration proceedings, challenging the termination and seeking damages.",
    "Petition Filed": "The Petitioner filed an Original Petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking to set aside the Arbitral Award dated 06.06.2014, which had rejected the Petitioner's claims and awarded damages to the first Respondent.",
    "Legal Issues": "The primary legal issue was whether the stipulation in clause 4.1 (a) of the MSA, read with Schedule 1 thereto, constituted liquidated damages or a penalty. Other issues included the liability of the Petitioner for breach of the MSA, the quantum of damages, and the applicability of interest on the bank guarantee amount.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the stipulation in clause 4.1 (a) of the MSA, read with Schedule 1 thereto, is a stipulation by way of liquidated damages or penalty.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The Petitioner argued that clause 4.1 (a) stipulated a penalty, not liquidated damages, and that the first Respondent had failed to prove actual loss. They emphasized the use of the term \"penalty\" in the contract and highlighted the first Respondent's failure to provide G2C services, arguing that their failure to roll out CSCs was not a breach.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The first Respondent argued that the stipulation in clause 4.1 (a) was a liquidated damages clause, and that they had provided evidence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss at the time of contract formation. They also contended that Indian law does not differentiate between liquidated damages and penalty.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court concluded that the stipulation in clause 4.1 (a) constituted liquidated damages, as it bore a reasonable correlation to anticipated loss at the time of contract formation. However, the court found that the first Respondent had failed to prove actual loss for the period between 01.04.2009 and 30.04.2009, thus setting aside the award of liquidated damages for that period. The court upheld the award for the period between 01.11.2009 and 31.01.2010, as G2C services were available during that period. The court also revised the award for interest on the bank guarantee amount, restricting it to the period when the first Respondent was unable to enforce the guarantee due to an interim order.",
    "Decision": "The court partly set aside the Arbitral Award, reducing the award of liquidated damages to the first Respondent and revising the interest payable on the bank guarantee amount.",
    "Conclusion": "The court found that the stipulation in clause 4.1 (a) constituted liquidated damages, but the first Respondent had failed to prove actual loss for a specific period. The court, therefore, partly set aside the award, adjusting the amounts payable.",
    "Case Summary": "The Petitioner challenged the Arbitral Award that awarded damages to the first Respondent, arguing that the contract stipulated a penalty rather than liquidated damages. The court, after reviewing the contract and evidence, ruled that the stipulation constituted liquidated damages but found that the first Respondent had not proven actual loss for a specific period. The court, therefore, partly set aside the award, adjusting the amounts payable."

    "Key Legal Questions": "The key legal question addressed by the court was whether the plaintiff had a valid maritime claim against the defendant's vessel that justified the arrest of the vessel, and whether the dispute should be referred to arbitration.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The plaintiff argued that they were the owners of the cargo, as they had placed the order for the oil and taken delivery of it at Karaikal Port. The plaintiff further argued that the vessel's unseaworthiness and delay in delivery constituted a maritime claim, justifying the arrest of the vessel. The plaintiff also argued that the arbitration clause was not applicable, as the defendant was not a party to the charter party.",

Plaintiffs paid a sum of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- towards the total consideration of Rs. 6,15,00,000/-.

The deal included immovable properties owned by GWL Properties Limited (formerly Gordon Woodroffe Limited), a subsidiary. Disputes arose over the condition of the properties, and the buyer sought to refer the matter to arbitration.",

    "Legal Issues": "Whether the Share Purchase Agreement was determinable in nature, whether GWL Properties Limited was bound by the arbitration clause, and whether the court could grant injunctions against GWL Properties Limited as a non-party to the arbitration.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Can a court grant injunctions against a third party, not party to an arbitration clause, to preserve the subject matter of an arbitral proceeding?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The plaintiff argued that the Share Purchase Agreement was not determinable in nature, GWL Properties Limited was bound by the arbitration clause, and that the court had the power to grant injunctions against non-parties to preserve the subject matter of the arbitration.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The defendants argued that the Share Purchase Agreement was determinable, GWL Properties Limited was not bound by the arbitration clause, and that the court lacked the power to grant injunctions against third parties.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that while the power to grant injunctions under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is limited to parties to the arbitration agreement, the court can grant injunctions against third parties to preserve the subject matter of the arbitration. The court found that a prima facie case existed for granting injunctions, as the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury if the defendants were allowed to alienate or encumber the properties.",
    "Decision": "The court allowed the appeals filed by Embassy Property Developments Limited and granted the injunctions sought. The appeals filed by GWL Properties Limited were dismissed.",
    "Conclusion": "The court held that while the Share Purchase Agreement might be determinable, the court could grant injunctions to preserve the subject matter of the arbitration until the arbitral tribunal decided the issue. The court also held that the court had the power to grant injunctions against GWL Properties Limited, even though it was not a party to the arbitration clause, to preserve the subject matter of the arbitration.",
    "Case Summary": "The court found that the Share Purchase Agreement, though potentially determinable, warranted the grant of injunctions against the defendants to protect the plaintiff's interests. The court also held that its power to grant injunctions against third parties, as per Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, was broad enough to include GWL Properties Limited. The court therefore granted the injunctions requested by Embassy Property Developments Limited, while dismissing the appeals filed by GWL Properties Limited."

    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the Arbitrator erred in granting specific performance of the Agreement to Sell in favor of the seller?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioner argued that the Agreement was only an Agreement to Sell, not a concluded Sale, and the seller cannot seek specific performance. The petitioner further argued that the seller can only claim damages for the loss suffered due to the breach of contract.",

The court ruled that the seller could not seek specific performance in this case because the seller could be adequately compensated in terms of money. The court further determined that the seller could not claim the full purchase price because the shares had not been sold or transferred to the buyer. The court concluded that the Arbitrator's findings were perverse, arbitrary, illegal, and illogical and that the Arbitral Award was patently illegal.",

    "Facts": "The plaintiff, a builder, stood as guarantor for a loan taken by a company, Arul Saw Mills, from the first defendant. Arul Saw Mills defaulted on the loan, and the first defendant filed a suit against the plaintiff and the company, obtaining an ex-parte decree.

The plaintiff argued that he had settled the loan amount with the first defendant but that she maliciously initiated the insolvency proceedings.",
    "Petition Filed": "The plaintiff filed a civil suit seeking damages from the defendants for publishing the plaintiff as \"Insolvent\" in a newspaper, which he claimed damaged his reputation.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages for loss of reputation, whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the damages, whether the second defendant is liable for the damages caused to the plaintiff, and what relief the parties are entitled to.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the first defendant's actions in initiating insolvency proceedings against the plaintiff, even after receiving full payment of the loan amount, constituted defamation and warranted damages.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The plaintiff argued that the first defendant maliciously initiated insolvency proceedings against him despite receiving full payment of the loan amount, causing him significant reputational damage.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The defendants argued that they were entitled to initiate insolvency proceedings because the plaintiff had not repaid the loan amount as a guarantor, and that the publication in the newspaper was merely a consequence of the insolvency proceedings. The second defendant argued that he was only a finance broker and had no role in the insolvency proceedings.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that while the first defendant had initiated insolvency proceedings, the plaintiff had subsequently repaid the loan amount. The court also noted that the plaintiff had failed to provide sufficient evidence that the first defendant acted with malice or that the publication in the newspaper had significantly damaged his reputation.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the plaintiff's suit, finding that he was not entitled to damages.",

The respondents filed a counter stating that the obligations were independent and not reciprocal.",
    "Petition Filed": "Applications were filed to set aside the orders passed by the learned Master in the execution petitions.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the earlier judgment of the Division Bench in O.S.A Nos.202 and 203 of 2005 arising in Insolvency proceedings is binding on the parties in the execution proceedings on principles of res judicata? Whether the order passed in the execution proceeding as confirmed by the learned single Judge in the appeals, is sustainable under law?",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether a judgment in insolvency proceedings that determined the nature of a compromise decree as not being a decree for payment of money is binding on the parties in subsequent execution proceedings under the principle of res judicata?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The appellants argued that the Division Bench judgment in the insolvency proceedings was binding on the parties in the execution proceedings under res judicata. They contended that the decree was a composite decree that imposed mutual obligations.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents argued that the insolvency proceedings and execution proceedings were separate and distinct. They asserted that the obligations under the compromise decree were independent and not reciprocal.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that the issue in the insolvency proceedings was jurisdiction, which was a distinct issue from the enforceability of the terms of the compromise decree in the execution proceedings. It found that the earlier judgments did not address the enforceability of the obligations under the compromise decree and therefore, the principle of res judicata did not apply.",

    "Facts": "TAQA Neyveli Power Company Private Limited (Claimant) and NLC India Limited (Respondent) had a Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) where the Claimant was obligated to purchase lignite from the Respondent. The Claimant alleged that it was unable to lift the agreed quantity of lignite due to a 'Force Majeure event' resulting from a lower Merit Order Ranking by the TNERC. The Respondent claimed liquidated damages for the shortfall in off-take.",
    "Petition Filed": "The Claimant petitioned to set aside the Arbitral Award, arguing that the PPA between the Claimant and TANGEDCO was interlinked with the FSA, a 'Force Majeure event' had occurred, the liquidated damages were not justified, and the Respondent should have mitigated its losses. The Respondent filed a separate petition seeking to set aside parts of the Award related to its counterclaims and pendente lite interest.",
    "Legal Issues": "The key legal issues were whether the PPA could be relied upon, whether a 'Force Majeure event' occurred, whether the liquidated damages were justified, whether the Respondent was obligated to mitigate its losses, and whether the Respondent was entitled to interest on the liquidated damages.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "The key legal question was whether the 'Force Majeure event' clause in the FSA was triggered by the TNERC's Merit Order Ranking, which resulted in lower dispatch of power to the Claimant's plant and consequently, the Claimant's inability to lift the agreed quantity of lignite.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The Claimant argued that the PPA and FSA were interlinked, a 'Force Majeure event' had occurred, the liquidated damages were not justified, and the Respondent should have mitigated its losses.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The Respondent argued that the PPA and FSA were not interlinked, no 'Force Majeure event' had occurred, the liquidated damages were justified, and it was not obligated to mitigate its losses.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The Court found that the PPA and FSA were not interlinked, no 'Force Majeure event' had occurred, the liquidated damages were justified, and the Respondent was not obligated to mitigate its losses. The Court reasoned that the Claimant could have supplied power to TANGEDCO at a lower price, thereby mitigating its losses. It also found that the Respondent had suffered a loss due to the Claimant's failure to lift the agreed quantity of lignite and was entitled to liquidated damages.",
    "Decision": "The Court dismissed the Claimant's petition, except for the modification of the interest rate on liquidated damages from 18% to 12% per annum. The Court allowed the Respondent's petition regarding the interest on liquidated damages, awarding interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the debit note till the date of the award. The Court also confirmed the remaining aspects of the Arbitral Award.",
    "Conclusion": "The Court concluded that the Claimant's inability to lift the agreed quantity of lignite was not due to a 'Force Majeure event' but a result of its business decision not to quote a competitive price for power supply to TANGEDCO. The Court held that the Respondent was entitled to liquidated damages as per the terms of the FSA and was not obligated to mitigate its losses.",
    "Case Summary": "The Court held that the PPA and FSA were not interlinked and the 'Force Majeure event' clause in the FSA was not triggered. The Court found that the liquidated damages awarded were justified and the Respondent was entitled to interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the liquidated damages from the date of the debit note till the date of the award. The Court dismissed the Claimant's petition and allowed the Respondent's petition to the extent of awarding interest."

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioner argued that TANGEDCO should have filed a claim during the insolvency proceedings and that its demand is extinguished under the Clean Slate Theory as established by the Supreme Court in Ghanashyam Mishra.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "TANGEDCO argued that its claim is governed by the Electricity Act, 2003 and the Electricity Supply Code and that the petitioner must pay its dues.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the petitioner was a MSME company that participated in the resolution process and chose not to disclose its debt to TANGEDCO. The court also noted that the Clean Slate Theory does not apply automatically and is subject to the fairness of the resolution plan. The court held that the Adjudicating Authority has the power to review the resolution plan to ensure that operational creditors are treated fairly and equitably.",

    "Facts": "The petitioners, working as Electricians and Maintenance Assistants for the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD Board), claimed permanent status after completing 480 days of continuous service, as per the Conferment of Permanent Status Act. Despite representations, the respondents failed to regularize their services. The fourth respondent, the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, granted permanent status, but the respondents still refused to implement the award.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioners sought a writ of Mandamus directing the first respondent to implement the award dated 5.3.2018, passed by the fourth respondent in proceedings Na.Ka. No.A/36/2015, conferring permanent status.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishment (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen), 1981 applies to TWAD Board employees for permanent absorption and regularization, whether the legal principles in State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi, 2006 (4) SCC 1, are followed regarding appointments, regularization and permanent absorption, and whether the TWAD Board Service Regulations, 1972 prevail over the Conferment of Permanent Status Act.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Does the Conferment of Permanent Status Act apply to TWAD Board employees, and if not, does the award granting permanent status need to be implemented?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioners argued that they had completed 480 days of continuous service and were therefore entitled to permanent status under the Conferment of Permanent Status Act. They also cited a case where the Madurai Bench granted similar benefits to other employees.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents argued that the TWAD Board Act and Service Regulations prevail over the Conferment of Permanent Status Act, thus making the Act inapplicable to their employees. They also argued that other judgments rejected similar claims for permanent status.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the TWAD Board Act and Service Regulations constituted a special law governing the board, taking precedence over the general law of the Conferment of Permanent Status Act. The court also held that the Constitution Bench's decision in Uma Devi, which requires appointments and regularizations to be made following established rules, was binding precedent. This decision undermined previous judgments granting permanent status based solely on service duration, which violated the constitutional scheme of appointments. The court emphasized the need to ensure fair competition and equal opportunity in public employment.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the writ petition, finding that the petitioners' claim lacked merit due to the applicability of the special law governing the TWAD Board and the binding precedent established by Uma Devi.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the petitioners were not entitled to permanent status under the Conferment of Permanent Status Act as it was not applicable to TWAD Board employees, and the award granted by the fourth respondent was against the principles established by the Constitution Bench.",
    "Case Summary": "The petitioners sought permanent status based on the Conferment of Permanent Status Act. The respondents argued that the TWAD Board's special law governing their employees made the Act inapplicable.

    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the sale agreement was not a valid document because it was not attested by independent witnesses and was typed at a location where the defendant was not present.

The plaintiff also argued that the service provided was not a contract of personal service and therefore, Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act was not applicable.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The defendant argued that the plaintiff was terminated due to his refusal to adhere to the advice of the defendant endowment and that the plaintiff was a licensee and not a tenant. The defendant further argued that the plaintiff's service was a contract of personal service and therefore, the suit was barred under Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act.",

    "Facts": "The appellant (S&S Foundations) entered into a MoU with the respondents (Gnanasekaran) to procure 120 acres of land for a real estate project. The respondents failed to procure the land within the stipulated time, and the parties entered into a Supplemental MoU reducing the target acreage. The respondents continued to fail to procure the land. The appellant filed arbitration proceedings, claiming breach of contract and damages. The arbitrator found in favor of the appellant, awarding 15% of the appellant's investment as damages. The High Court reversed the arbitrator's decision, holding that the appellant had failed to prove its loss.",
    "Petition Filed": "The appellant sought a declaration that the respondents breached the MoU and Supplemental MoU, directing them to pay damages for loss of project, loss of interest, additional expenditure, and costs of the arbitral proceedings.",
    "Legal Issues": "The legal issues involved were whether the respondents breached the MoU and Supplemental MoU, whether the appellant was entitled to damages, and the appropriate measure of damages.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "The key legal question was whether the appellant was entitled to damages for breach of contract, even though it had not proven specific financial loss.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The appellant argued that the respondents breached the agreement by failing to procure the land as agreed, resulting in financial losses. They argued that the arbitrator's 15% damage award was reasonable, as the respondents failed to meet their obligations, causing the appellant to incur additional expenses and loss of potential profit.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents argued that they did not breach the agreement, as they procured a significant portion of the land and were still working to acquire the remaining parcels. They contended that the appellant was entitled to procure the remaining land themselves and deduct the cost from the respondents' share, as per the agreement.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The High Court reasoned that the appellant had failed to provide adequate evidence of its financial loss resulting from the respondent's failure to procure the land. The court referred to previous rulings that require a party claiming damages to prove its loss, even if the breach of contract is clear. The court further considered the appellant's right to procure the remaining land themselves, as outlined in the agreement, and determined that the appellant did not adequately pursue this option.",
    "Decision": "The High Court overturned the arbitrator's decision, finding that the appellant was not entitled to damages because it had not adequately proven its financial loss.",
    "Conclusion": "The High Court concluded that the appellant failed to establish a valid claim for damages, as it did not provide adequate evidence of its loss. The court upheld the respondents' argument that the appellant could have procured the remaining land themselves, which would have mitigated their potential losses.",
    "Case Summary": "The appellant argued that the respondents breached the agreements by failing to procure the land as agreed, causing financial losses. They cited previous case law to argue that the arbitrator was justified in awarding damages without specific proof of loss, due to the clear breach. The respondents argued that they did not breach the agreements and that the appellant had the opportunity to procure the remaining land themselves. The High Court found that the appellant failed to prove its loss, ruling in favor of the respondents and overturning the arbitrator's decision."

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The respondent argued that the initiation of proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a statutory one and is distinct from the proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. They argued that Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 prohibits the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the Corporate Debtor, but does not prohibit criminal proceedings.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The court held that the offence under the Negotiable Instruments Act is a statutory one and the proceedings under the Negotiable Instruments Act are completely different from the Corporate Insolvency Resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The court further held that Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 prohibits the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the Corporate Debtor, but does not prohibit criminal proceedings.",

The defendant argued that the annulment order became ineffective upon the dismissal of the insolvency petition and that the claimants were not bonafide purchasers. The defendant also argued that the claimants did not plead fraud and did not provide evidence to support their claims.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that the Insolvency Court had no jurisdiction to annul the sale deeds as the judgment debtor was not adjudged insolvent. The court concluded that the annulment order was without jurisdiction and void. The court further held that the annulment order became ineffective after the dismissal of the insolvency petition. The court found that the decree holder and the court auction purchaser had suppressed material facts and committed fraud on the court and the claimants.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the appeals and the revision petition. The court directed the decree holder to deposit the amount withdrawn from the court deposit and ordered the court auction purchaser to withdraw the amount upon such deposit.",
    "Conclusion": "The court found that the Insolvency Court's order annulling the sale deeds was void and ineffective, as the judgment debtor was not adjudged insolvent at the time of the petition.

    "Case Summary": "The court dismissed the appeals and revision petition, finding that the Insolvency Court had no jurisdiction to annul the sale deeds and that the annulment order was void and ineffective. The court also found that the decree holder and the court auction purchaser had committed fraud by suppressing material facts related to the existence of buildings on the property. The court directed the decree holder to deposit the withdrawn amount and allowed the court auction purchaser to withdraw the amount upon such deposit."

    "Facts": "Cane growers in Kammapuram Firka, Cuddalore District supplied sugarcane to Shree Ambika Sugars Limited (SASL), which went into liquidation. The Commissioner of Sugar temporarily allotted the area to EID Parry (India) Limited (EIDPIL) in 2019. In 2021, the Commissioner of Sugar temporarily reallocated the area to MRK Co-operative Sugar Mills (MRK). The cane growers and EIDPIL challenged this reallocation.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioners in both writ petitions filed for certiorari to call for the records of the impugned order dated 28.10.2022 passed by the Commissioner of Sugar and to quash the same.",

    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents argued that the Cane Commissioner had the authority to reallocate the area under the Sugar (Control) Order 1966. They also argued that MRK was a cooperative society with the support of the government, while EIDPIL was a private limited company with a higher risk of financial instability. They further argued that the reallocation was temporary and based on factors like MRK's lower crushing capacity, shorter distance to the sugarcane fields, and the proposed land acquisition by the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the Cane Commissioner had followed due process by hearing the representations of all stakeholders. The court determined that the factors considered by the Cane Commissioner \u2013 MRK's lower crushing capacity, the shorter distance to the sugarcane fields, and the proposed land acquisition by the Neyveli Lignite Corporation \u2013 were relevant and justified the reallocation. The court also noted the government's support for cooperative societies like MRK, which provided financial security for cane growers.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed both writ petitions. The court imposed costs on EIDPIL for not taking a more conciliatory approach and for not reaching out to MRK and the cane growers to facilitate an amicable solution.",

    "Case Summary": "The petitioners argued that the Cane Commissioner\u2019s reallocation of sugarcane land was arbitrary and illegal and caused them economic hardship, while the respondents argued that the reallocation was temporary, justified under the Sugar (Control) Order, and based on factors like MRK\u2019s lower crushing capacity, shorter distance to the fields, and proposed land acquisition.

After the demise of the plaintiff's mother, his father married the first defendant on 27.05.1976 at Singapore. His father and the first defendant had lived together at Singapore and subsequently they got married. A female child was born to them out of their marital wedlock. The said female child is shown as the second defendant in the suit. The first defendant and the plaintiff's father jointly purchased the suit property through a registered sale deed dated 08.02.1971. The father of the plaintiff had executed a registered settlement deed dated 08.02.2008 in respect of his undivided half share in the suit property in favour of the plaintiff.

They also filed a suit for judicial separation by mutual consent before the High Court of the Republic of Singapore and it was recorded by the Court and thereafter, judicial separation was also granted by the High Court of the Republic of Singapore.

    "Petition Filed": "The petitioner filed a criminal original petition seeking bail in the case. He argued that he was not involved in the day-to-day management of SCL and was not responsible for the classification of loans as Non Performing Assets.

    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the petitioner had not met the requirements for bail and dismissed the Criminal Original Petition.",

The court found no evidence to support the second defendant's allegations of coercion and undue influence, and determined that the first plaintiff had accepted the gift by possessing the deed. The court ruled that the cancellation deed was invalid as the first defendant did not reserve the power of revocation in the original deed.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the Appeal Suit, confirming the judgment and decree passed by the Principal District Court, Dindigul.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the gift settlement deed was valid and acted upon, while the cancellation deed was invalid due to the lack of a revocation clause in the original deed.",
    "Case Summary": "The court examined the evidence regarding the gift settlement deed, finding no evidence of coercion or undue influence. The court also determined that the first plaintiff's possession of the deed was sufficient to establish acceptance. The court dismissed the appeal, upholding the lower court's judgment, finding that the gift deed was valid and the cancellation deed was invalid."

    "Court": "High Court of Judicature at Madras",
    "Case Status": "Judgement",
    "Judges Involved": "S.M.Subramaniam",
    "Sections and Clauses": "Article 226 of the Constitution of India, Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, Section 3, Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board Act, 1970, Article 12, Article 14, Article 16, Article 21, Article 309, Article 141, Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946",
    "Facts": "The contesting respondents were engaged as Contract Labourers for the purpose of Operation and Maintenance of Combined Water Schemes. Contractors, who employed the labourers, are bound to execute the works allotted by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD Board). The contractors change every year and the TWAD Board settle the payments in favour of the contractors, who in turn, pay the wages to the Labourers.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioners, TWAD Board, sought to quash the award passed by the Inspector of Labour, Kanchipuram, which confirmed the permanent status to the contract labourers.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the TWAD Board, as an instrumentality of the State, is bound to follow its own service regulations in the matter of permanent absorption of its employees, even if the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, which mandates permanent status after 480 days of service, is applicable. Whether the Inspector of Labour's decision to confer permanent status, based solely on the completion of 480 days of service, is in violation of the constitutional scheme of appointments and the service regulations of the TWAD Board.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India in Umadevi\u2019s case, which holds that courts cannot direct the regularization of temporary employees without following the constitutional scheme of appointments, supersede the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, in the context of public employment in an instrumentality of the State.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioners, TWAD Board, argued that there was no direct employer-employee relationship between them and the respondents. They stated that the respondents were engaged by contractors and that the TWAD Board only supervised the projects. The TWAD Board claimed that the respondents were not appointed by them and that they were not entitled to permanent status under the TWAD Board service regulations. The petitioners emphasized the binding precedent set by the Supreme Court in Umadevi\u2019s case, which restricts the courts from interfering with the constitutional scheme of appointments in public services.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents, the contract labourers, argued that they were continuously working for the TWAD Board, despite the change of contractors every year. They claimed that they were directly supervised by the TWAD Board authorities and that their employment was permanent in nature. They relied on the unambiguous provisions of the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, which mandates permanent status after 480 days of service. They cited various judgments passed by the High Court and the Supreme Court, which upheld the principle of automatic conferment of permanent status upon completion of 480 days of service.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court examined the applicable legislation, the service regulations of the TWAD Board, and the relevant judgments of the Supreme Court, including the Constitution Bench decision in Umadevi\u2019s case. The court concluded that the TWAD Board Act and its service regulations constitute special law governing the employment of the Board\u2019s employees. Therefore, the general law, including the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, cannot override the special law governing the TWAD Board. The court held that the Inspector of Labour, in mechanically granting permanent status based solely on the completion of 480 days of service, had violated the constitutional scheme of appointments and the service regulations of the TWAD Board.",
    "Decision": "The court allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned order passed by the Inspector of Labour.",
    "Conclusion": "The court found that the TWAD Board Act and its service regulations constituted special law governing the TWAD Board's employees. The court concluded that the Inspector of Labour's mechanical application of the general law to confer permanent status was unconstitutional and in violation of the TWAD Board's service regulations.",
    "Case Summary": "The TWAD Board challenged the Inspector of Labour's award granting permanent status to contract labourers. The petitioners argued that they were not the direct employers and that the service regulations of the TWAD Board governed appointments. The respondents relied on the 480 days service requirement under the Conferment of Permanent Status Act. The court found that the TWAD Board Act and service regulations constituted special law, which superseded the general law. The court held that the Inspector of Labour's decision was unconstitutional and in violation of the TWAD Board's service regulations, and quashed the award."

    "Facts": "The case involves a cross border corporate dispute between Take Solutions Singapore Pte Limited, a Singaporean holding company, and its subsidiary, Take Solutions Limited, incorporated in India. The holding company defaulted on its debts to lenders, resulting in the Singapore High Court appointing an Interim Judicial Manager (IJM) named Patrick Bance on October 18, 2021. The dispute centers on the sale of the Indian subsidiary's CRO business to H.I.G. Taurus Pte. Ltd and H.I.G. Taurus EAL Pte. Limited for USD 101.63 million, which was approved in an EGM held on October 23, 2021.

They claimed the Scrutinizer correctly invalidated the vote cast by the suspended management and rejected the IJM's request to vote, following the Companies (Management and Administration) Rules, 2014. They also asserted that the principle of comity of courts does not apply in this case, as the Scrutinizer acted according to the Singapore High Court's orders and the IJM filed a separate suit in India.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the Scrutinizer arbitrarily and illegally rejected the IJM's request to vote in the EGM, despite the Singapore High Court's orders appointing him as the IJM and invalidating the vote cast by the suspended management. The court ruled that the principle of comity of courts applies in this case and that the Indian court has jurisdiction to intervene.",
    "Decision": "The court granted the IJM's application for an interim injunction, making it absolute. The court dismissed the applications filed by the Indian subsidiary and its directors, but allowed the impleading applications filed by Indus Bank and Axis Bank as party defendants. The court also clarified that the Indian subsidiary can convene a fresh EGM to seek shareholder approval for the sale of the CRO business after giving proper notice to all shareholders, including the IJM.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the Scrutinizer's decision to reject the IJM's request to vote in the EGM was arbitrary and illegal, and that the resolution approving the sale of the CRO business was therefore invalid. The court also found that the principle of comity of courts applies in this case and that the Indian court has jurisdiction to intervene.",
    "Case Summary": "The court determined that the Indian subsidiary and its directors disregarded the Singapore High Court's orders appointing the IJM. The court found that the Scrutinizer acted improperly by rejecting the IJM's request to vote. The court ruled that the Indian subsidiary can convene a fresh EGM after giving proper notice to all shareholders, including the IJM. The court emphasized the need for transparency and due diligence in the sale process to ensure the interests of all stakeholders are protected."

They claimed his resignation was accepted only in 2007, after he joined the competing company, making him ineligible for commission.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court analyzed the relevant legal provisions and the judgment cited by the petitioner. It concluded that resignation is automatic after one month's notice and joining a competing company does not automatically disqualify an agent from receiving commission.",

    "Sections and Clauses": "Article 226 of the Constitution of India, Section 10A to 10D of the Indian Medical Council Act 1956",
    "Facts": "The petitioners, MBBS graduates, challenged Clause 4.5 of the Handbook for admission to DNB Board Specialty Courses (Post MBBS) 2020 Admission Session. This clause prevented candidates who froze their seat allotment in the first round of counseling from participating in subsequent rounds. The petitioners argued that this restricted their right to upgrade their choices and sacrificed merit.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioners filed two writ petitions: WP No: 7720 of 2020, seeking to quash Clause 4.5, and WP No: 8193 of 2020, seeking a mandamus forbearing the respondents from conducting the second round of counselling without rectifying the clause.",
    "Legal Issues": "1) Whether the court had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petitions.",

    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioners argued that Clause 4.5 was arbitrary and sacrificed merit by preventing meritorious candidates from participating in subsequent rounds of counseling. They relied upon the Post Graduate Regulations 2000 framed by the MCI and the NBE's own previous practice. They also argued that the NBE was bound to follow the MCI regulations.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents, NBE and MCI, argued that the NBE was an independent and autonomous body with the right to formulate its own procedure for admission. They contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to interfere with the counseling process as it had already begun and that the petitioners had accepted the terms of the Handbook by participating. They also pointed out that the MCI's regulations were not applicable to the DNB courses offered by the NBE.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petitions as the NBE's actions affected individuals nationwide and a part of the cause of action arose within the court's jurisdiction. The court acknowledged that the petitioners' challenge was belated but found that allowing the challenge would significantly delay the counseling process. The court further found that the NBE, as an autonomous body, was entitled to formulate its own procedures for admission and was not bound by the MCI regulations. Additionally, the court considered the Delhi High Court's previous decisions upholding similar clauses in the NBE's Handbooks.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed both writ petitions, finding that the NBE's autonomy, the potential disruption of the counseling process, and the precedent set by the Delhi High Court outweighed the petitioners' concerns regarding merit and the right to upgrade choices.",
    "Conclusion": "#VALUE!",
    "Case Summary": "The court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petitions as the NBE's actions affected individuals nationwide and a part of the cause of action arose within the court's jurisdiction.

    "Facts": "S.Divya's father had two life insurance policies with LIC. He died on 04/01/2012. LIC rejected the claim on the ground that the insured had suppressed information about his treatment for a prior accident in the proposal form. The Ombudsman partly allowed the claim, finding no nexus between the accident and the cause of death but rejecting the claim based on the suppression of facts.",

    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondent argued that any suppressed facts must be considered material. They contended that the insured's treatment history was suppressed, which impacted the risk taken by the insurer.",

    "Court": "High Court of Judicature at Madras",
    "Case Status": "Order",
    "Judges Involved": "Dr. Justice Anita Sumanth",
    "Sections and Clauses": "Article 226 of the Constitution of India, Section 16 of the Companies Act, 2013, Section 22 of the Companies Act, 1956, Section 299(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, Section 16(1)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act, 2013, Section 18 of Finance Act 1956, Section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1922, Rule 5 of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955",
    "Facts": "The petitioner, Sri Krishna Sweets and Food Products (Chennai) Pvt. Ltd., and the second respondent, Sri Krishna Sweets Pvt. Ltd., are both owned by brothers. The petitioner was incorporated in 2009. The second respondent filed an application in 2016 seeking rectification of the petitioner\u2019s name under Section 16 of the Companies Act, 2013, arguing that the names were too similar. The petitioner challenged the application, arguing that it was barred by limitation and that the second respondent had no grounds for seeking rectification.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioner filed a Writ Petition seeking a writ of prohibition to restrain the Joint Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from exercising jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the rectification application.",
    "Legal Issues": "The legal issues were whether the Joint Director had jurisdiction to proceed with the application given the bar of limitation under Section 16 of the Companies Act, 2013, and whether the second respondent had a valid claim under Section 16(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "The key legal question was whether the limitation period for filing an application under Section 16(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013, runs from the date of incorporation of the company or from the date the applicant became aware of the company's existence.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioner argued that the limitation period was three years from the date of incorporation, which had already passed. They also argued that the second respondent could not rely on Section 16(1)(a) as the application was filed by a third party.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The second respondent argued that the limitation period should run from the date they became aware of the company\u2019s existence in 2015 and that they had a valid claim under Section 16(1)(b) as the petitioner\u2019s name closely resembled their trademark.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that the limitation period under Section 16(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013, runs from the date of incorporation of the company and not from the date the applicant became aware of its existence. The court also held that the second respondent\u2019s application was barred by limitation as it was filed beyond the three-year period. The court rejected the second respondent\u2019s argument that they had a valid claim under Section 16(1)(a) as the application was filed by a third party and not the Central Government.",
    "Decision": "The court granted the Writ Petition, prohibiting the Joint Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from exercising jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the rectification application.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the second respondent\u2019s application for rectification of the petitioner\u2019s name was barred by limitation and that the Joint Director had no jurisdiction to proceed with the application.",
    "Case Summary": "The petitioner, Sri Krishna Sweets and Food Products (Chennai) Pvt. Ltd., challenged the application filed by the second respondent, Sri Krishna Sweets Pvt. Ltd., seeking rectification of the petitioner\u2019s name under Section 16 of the Companies Act, 2013. The petitioner argued that the application was barred by limitation as it was filed more than three years after the petitioner\u2019s incorporation. The court agreed with the petitioner, holding that the limitation period runs from the date of incorporation, not from the date the second respondent became aware of the company\u2019s existence. The court granted the Writ Petition, prohibiting the Joint Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from exercising jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the rectification application."

    "Date": "02/05/2017",
    "Court": "HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS",

    "Judges Involved": "Dr. JUSTICE S.VIMALA",
    "Sections and Clauses": "Article 227 of the Constitution of India, Section 115 of the CPC",
    "Facts": "The petitioner company, a public sector company, terminated a contract with the first respondent company, a power management solutions provider, thrice. The petitioner attempted to invoke a bank guarantee provided by the first respondent, but the guarantee expired. The petitioner filed a civil suit and a civil miscellaneous appeal seeking to keep the bank guarantee alive.",
    "Petition Filed": "The petitioner filed a civil revision petition to challenge an order by the XIX Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai, that issued notice to the respondents instead of granting an interim order to keep the bank guarantee alive.",
    "Legal Issues": "1) Maintainability of the revision petition under Section 115 of the CPC. 2) Whether the court should have granted an interim order to keep the bank guarantee alive despite a caveat pending. 3) Whether the petitioner's actions amounted to suppression of material facts and forum shopping.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Is a revision petition maintainable against an order issuing notice in a civil miscellaneous appeal where a caveat is pending and the bank guarantee has expired?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The petitioner argued that the court should have granted an interim order to safeguard the bank guarantee, which was expiring. They cited a Supreme Court decision that allows keeping bank guarantees alive during proceedings.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondent argued that the petitioner was guilty of suppression of material facts, forum shopping, and suppression of pending parallel proceedings. They contended that the bank guarantee had expired and the petitioner's actions amounted to fraud.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court held that the revision petition was not maintainable under Section 115 of the CPC, as the order challenged was not a final order. The court found that the petitioner should have insisted on the court hearing the matter after issuing directions to the respondent to file a counter. The court also found that the petitioner's actions amounted to forum shopping and suppression of material facts.",
    "Decision": "The court dismissed the revision petitions, upholding the order of the XIX Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai, issuing notice to the respondents.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the revision petitions were not maintainable and that the petitioner's actions were inappropriate.",
    "Case Summary": "The petitioner filed a civil revision petition to challenge an order issuing notice in a civil miscellaneous appeal.

    "Court": "Madras High Court, Madurai Bench",

    "Sections and Clauses": "Article 226 of the Constitution of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India (Agents) Rules 1972, Section 17 of the Contract Act 1872",
    "Facts": "Balasubramania Pillai was a LIC agent terminated for allegedly perpetrating fraud. He was accused of misrepresenting the age of a policyholder, Manikandan, who was the son of an LIC Panel Doctor. Pillai claimed he relied on Manikandan's horoscope.",
    "Petition Filed": "A writ petition seeking a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the order of termination and the forfeiture of renewal commissions.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the termination of the petitioner's agency was justified on grounds of fraud, and whether the petitioner is entitled to renewal commissions despite the termination.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the respondent Corporation had proven fraud on the part of the petitioner, thereby justifying the forfeiture of renewal commissions?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "Pillai argued that he had an unblemished service record, proposed over 900 policies, and relied on the age provided by the Panel Doctor. He contended that no fraud was committed and that the termination was based on a prejudicial act rather than fraud.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The respondents argued that Pillai, being acquainted with the Panel Doctor, was aware of the actual age of the policyholder and that his actions were detrimental to the corporation's interests. They claimed that Pillai failed to verify the age, resulting in a void contract due to the policyholder's minority.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the respondents failed to prove that Pillai committed fraud. It noted that the termination order was based on Pillai's actions being prejudicial to the corporation, not fraud. The court determined that since fraud was not proven, the termination could not justify the forfeiture of renewal commissions.",
    "Decision": "The writ petition was allowed to the extent that the petitioner was entitled to the renewal commission on the premium received during his tenure as an agent. The forfeiture of renewal commissions was set aside.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the respondents failed to demonstrate that Pillai's actions constituted fraud, and therefore the forfeiture of his renewal commissions was not justified.",
    "Case Summary": "Pillai, an LIC agent, was terminated for allegedly perpetrating fraud by misrepresenting the age of a policyholder, the son of an LIC Panel Doctor. While the corporation accused Pillai of fraud, the court found that the evidence did not support this claim. The court determined that the termination was based on Pillai's actions being detrimental to the corporation, not fraud. Therefore, the court ruled that Pillai was entitled to renewal commissions, overturning the previous order that forfeited his commissions."

    "Court": "HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS",

    "Judges Involved": "ABDUL QUDDHOSE",
    "Sections and Clauses": "Section 11 (6) (a) and (c) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996",
    "Facts": "Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) suffered damage due to floods in Chennai in December 2015. CPCL filed a claim with Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (RGICL) for the loss under two All risk Package Insurance Policies. RGICL admitted the claim but applied two deductibles of Rs. 5 crores each for material damage and add-on cover, instead of one. CPCL objected, arguing it was entitled to a single deductible.",
    "Petition Filed": "CPCL filed two petitions under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking appointment of an arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute arising from the deductible and the withheld amount under the policies.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the dispute regarding the application of two deductibles is arbitrable in light of the consent letter signed by CPCL; Whether the consent letter was obtained under duress; Whether the respondent is liable to pay interest on the belatedly paid sum of Rs. 2.59 Crores.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the doctrine of accord and satisfaction applies to preclude arbitration in a case where the insured claims duress and coercion in obtaining the consent letter.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "CPCL argued that the consent letter was obtained under duress and that the respondent's threat to withhold payment unless the consent letter was signed constituted coercion. CPCL also argued that the arbitrability of the dispute is a matter to be decided by the arbitrator.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "RGICL argued that the consent letter was freely given by CPCL and that the dispute is not arbitrable because the matter is settled and CPCL cannot go back on their consent.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The Court held that the bargaining power of the insurer is much higher than that of the insured. While considering the circumstances and the nature of the insurance claim, there is a reasonable apprehension that the discharge vouchers were a pre-condition to the release of payments, which could indicate coercion.",
    "Decision": "The Court allowed the petitions and appointed Hon'ble Mr.Justice V.Ramasubramanian, Former Judge of the Supreme Court, as the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute.",
    "Conclusion": "The Court held that the dispute regarding the application of deductibles and the withheld amount is arbitrable, and the doctrine of accord and satisfaction does not apply in this case.",
    "Case Summary": "The Court concluded that the dispute is arbitrable as the consent letter was obtained under duress. The court appointed a sole arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute."

    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether a broad exclusion of 'genetic disorders' in health insurance policies is unconstitutional and violative of the right to health.",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The writ petition is maintainable against the public sector insurance company. The exclusion of genetic disorders is unreasonable and violates Article 14 of the Constitution. Recent Delhi High Court case M/s.United India Insurance Company Limited vs. Jai Parkash Tayal established that genetic disorder exclusion in health insurance policies is unconstitutional.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The Insurance company argued that the claim was rightly repudiated as genetic disorders are not covered under the policy. They also argued that the writ petition is not maintainable as it seeks to enforce a contractual right.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court found that the Insurance company is a public sector undertaking discharging a public duty and is therefore amenable to writ jurisdiction. The court cited various Supreme Court and Delhi High Court cases establishing the maintainability of writ petitions against public sector insurance companies. Applying the reasoning of the Delhi High Court in the Jai Parkash Tayal case, the court found that a broad exclusion of genetic disorders in insurance policies is unconstitutional and unreasonable.",
    "Decision": "The writ petition is allowed, the impugned orders are set aside, and the insurance company is directed to disburse the claim within two weeks.",

    "Facts": "P. Suresh (PSR) was engaged as a Product Developer by QDSeatamon Designs Private Limited (QDS Company) and terminated his employment in June 2017. QDS Company sent emails alleging that PSR's termination was not accepted due to his handling of sensitive information related to copyrights and intellectual property.

    "Defendant's Arguments": "The Defendant 3 argued that they were the rightful owners of the copyright based on the Loan Agreement and that the Plaintiff's broadcast of the film on the OTT platform without their consent constituted copyright infringement.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The Court found that the Loan Agreement granted the Defendant 3 exclusive rights to exploit the film on the satellite and OTT platforms. The Court further found that the Plaintiff's broadcast of the film on the OTT platform without the consent of the Defendant 3 constituted copyright infringement, despite the Assignment Agreement, which was deemed unreliable due to its late execution and lack of consideration.",

    "Conclusion": "The Court concluded that the Plaintiff's suit was not bona fide and was likely a preemptive measure to prevent the Defendant 3 from pursuing legal action. The Court also found that the Defendant 3 did not adequately prove their counterclaim for damages.",
    "Case Summary": "The Plaintiff sought a declaration that they had not infringed the copyright of the Defendant 3 and sought an injunction against the Defendant 3 from issuing groundless threats. The Defendant 3 claimed they were the rightful owners of the copyright and sought damages. The Court found that the Plaintiff infringed the copyright of the Defendant 3 and dismissed both the Plaintiff's claims and the Defendant 3's counterclaim.

    "Facts": "A deceased pedestrian was hit by a two-wheeler, the owner of which had paid the renewal premium to the insurance agent but the agent had not remitted the payment to the insurance company on time. The insurance company issued a policy with effect from the day after the accident.",
    "Petition Filed": "The claimants, relatives of the deceased, filed a claim petition against the owner, the insurance company, and the insurance agent, seeking compensation.",
    "Legal Issues": "Whether the insurance agent was liable for the accident, whether the insurance company was liable even though the policy was issued after the accident, and whether the insurance coverage commenced from the date of premium payment.",
    "Key Legal Questions": "Whether the insurance company was liable for the accident even though the policy was issued after the accident?",
    "Plaintiff's Arguments": "The claimants argued that the payment of premium to the agent is equivalent to payment to the company, and the company cannot take advantage of a delay in issuing the policy after receiving the premium.",
    "Defendant's Arguments": "The insurance company argued that the agent was not authorized to receive renewal premiums, that the premium was not credited to their account until after the accident, and that the policy only took effect from the date mentioned in the policy.",
    "Court's Reasoning": "The court ruled that the agent was authorized to receive renewal premiums as evidenced by the contract between the agent and the company. The court found that the insurance company was liable because they had accepted the premium, and because the insurance coverage starts from the date of premium payment, even if the policy is issued later. The court also found that the insurance agent was not liable for the accident.",
    "Decision": "The court partly allowed the appeal, exonerating the insurance agent and fixing the liability on the insurance company. The court confirmed the award of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal.",
    "Conclusion": "The court concluded that the insurance company was liable for the accident because the policy covered the vehicle at the time of the accident, and that the insurance agent was not liable.",
    "Case Summary": "The court determined that the insurance agent was authorized to receive renewal premiums, and that the insurance company was liable for the accident even though the policy was issued after the accident. The court reasoned that the insurance coverage commenced from the date of premium payment, and that the insurance company could not take advantage of a delay in issuing the policy. The court exonerated the insurance agent from liability for the accident."
